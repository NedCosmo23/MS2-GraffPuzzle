# Graff Memory Game

The idea for this project is to make a fun, visually interesting memory game. 

The game is simple in format, to start there are 6 'cards' with images which the user will see for around a second, then they will be 'face down'. To reveal the images again, the card must be clicked on, the user then has around a second of viewing the image before it is 'flipped over' again. 
The first 2 rounds will have 3x2 matching images, as the game progresses there will be more couples to match (4x2, 5x2, 6x2). The idea is to match the images in as short a time as possible.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User Stories
    -   First Time User Goals:
    1. As a first time user, I want the rules of the game to be easily accesible and understandable.
    2. As a first time user, I want the game to be aestheticilly pleasing as it is and entirely visual game.
    3. As a first time user, I want to feel challenged by the game.

-   Returning Time User Goals:

    1. As a returning visitor, I want to see if I can improve on my previous score/time.
    2. As a returning visitor, I want see if the game has been updated with more images/ different combinations.
    3. As a returning visitor, I want want to compete, show to, or even show off my skills to a friend.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colours used are not too loud so as to not take away or distract from the colours in the images.
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The fonts used are in keeping with the graffiti aesthetic (i.e. serif, hand drawn looking fonts).
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery makes up the large majority of the UX for this game, luckily graffiti is rich in source material. The hero image for the home page, before the game starts, is bright, colourful, and immediatley portrays the mood of the game to follow.

### Existing Features

- __Button to begin the game__

    - This is prominently placed on the home screen, and is a straightforward link to begin the game.



- __The landing page image__

    - The landing page image is there to catch peoples attention once they have arrived at the site, and is also an image of graffiti so as to set the tone of the entire site.

        INSERT LINK/IMAGE OF LANDING PAGE!

- __The Game__

  - This page is very simple in it's layout. The background of the page doesn't want to be too busy (i.e. with a backgorund image) as it will take the focus away from the game itself.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Bugs

I ran into quite a few issues when using different tutorials and templates. The tutorial/template I followed to create the game page ended up being quite limited, and when I tried to edit/add to it, I ran into a number of issues.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
